	abstract = {A variant of the popular nonparametric nonuniform intensity normalization (N3) algorithm is proposed for bias field correction. Given the superb performance of N3 and its public availability, it has been the subject of several evaluation studies. These studies have demonstrated the importance of certain parameters associated with the B-spline least-squares fitting. We propose the substitution of a recently developed fast and robust B-spline approximation routine and a modified hierarchical optimization scheme for improved bias field correction over the original N3 algorithm. Similar to the N3 algorithm, we also make the source code, testing, and technical documentation of our contribution, which we denote as “N4ITK,” available to the public through the Insight Toolkit of the National Institutes of Health. Performance assessment is demonstrated using simulated data from the publicly available Brainweb database, hyperpolarized 3 He lung image data, and 9.4T postmortem hippocampus data.},

	abstract = {One of the most challenging problems in modern neuroimaging is detailed characterization of neurodegeneration. Quantifying spatial and longitudinal atrophy patterns is an important component of this process. These spatiotemporal signals will aid in discriminating between related diseases, such as frontotemporal dementia ({FTD}) and Alzheimer's disease ({AD}), which manifest themselves in the same at-risk population. Here, we develop a novel symmetric image normalization method ({SyN}) for maximizing the cross-correlation within the space of diffeomorphic maps and provide the Euler-Lagrange equations necessary for this optimization. We then turn to a careful evaluation of our method. Our evaluation uses gold standard, human cortical segmentation to contrast {SyN}'s performance with a related elastic method and with the standard {ITK} implementation of Thirion's Demons algorithm. The new method compares favorably with both approaches, in particular when the distance between the template brain and the target brain is large. We then report the correlation of volumes gained by algorithmic cortical labelings of {FTD} and control subjects with those gained by the manual rater. This comparison shows that, of the three methods tested, {SyN}'s volume measurements are the most strongly correlated with volume measurements gained by expert labeling. This study indicates that {SyN}, with cross-correlation, is a reliable method for normalizing and making anatomical measurements in volumetric {MRI} of patients and at-risk elderly individuals.},
